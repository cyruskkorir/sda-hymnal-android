040,After a night of pain;
040,It comes as cooling showers
040,To some exhausted land
040,As shade of clustered palm trees
040,‘Mid weary wastes of sand.
040,2
040,Lord, we would bring for offering
040,Though marred with earthly soil
040,A week of earnest labor
040,Of steady, faithful toil
040,Fair fruits of self denial
040,Of strong, deep love to Thee
040,Fostered by Thine own Spirit
040,In true humility.
040,3
040,And we would bring our burden
040,Of sinful thought and deed
040,In Thy pure presence kneeling
040,From bondage to be freed
040,Our heart’s most bitter sorrow
040,For all Thy work undone-
040,So many talents wasted!
040,So few bright laurels won!
040,4
040,And with that sorrow mingling
040,A steadfast faith, and sure
040,And love so deep and fervent
040,For Thee to make it pure
040,In Thy dear presence finding
040,The pardon that we need
040,And then the peace so lasting-
040,Celestial peace indeed.

042,So we, when this new day is gone
042,And night in turn is drawing on
042,With conscience by the world unstained
042,Shall praise His name for vict’ry gained.

047,047 – God, Who Made the Earth and Heaven
047,1
047,God, who made the earth and heaven,
047,Darkness and light:
047,You the day for work have given
047,For rest the night.
047,May Your angel guards defend us
047,Slumber sweet Your mercy send us
047,Holy dreams and hopes attend us
047,All through the night.
047,2
047,And when morn again shall call us
047,to run life’s way
047,May we still, what-e’er befall us
047,Your will obey.
047,From the pow’r of evil hide us
047,In the narrow pathway guide us
047,Never be Your smile denied us
047,All through the day.
047,3
047,Guard us waking, guard us sleeping
047,And, when we die
047,May we in Your mighty keeping
047,All peaceful lie.
047,When the trumpet call shall wake us
047,Then, O Lord, do not forsake us
047,But to reign in glory take us
047,with You on high.
047,4
047,Holy Father, throned in heaven
047,All holy Son
047,Holy Spirit, freely given
047,Blest Three in One:
047,Grant us grace, we now implore You
047,Till we lay our crowns before You
047,And in worthier strains adore
047,You while ages run.
048,048 – Softly Now the Light of Day
048,1
048,Softly now the light of day
048,Fades upon out sight away:
048,Free from care, from labor free
048,Lord, we would commune with Thee.
048,2
048,Thou, whose allpervading eye
048,Nought escapes, without, within
048,Pardon each infirmity
048,Open fault, and secret sin.
048,3
048,Soon from us the light of day
048,Shall forever pass away;
048,Then, from sin and sorrow free
048,Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
049,049 – Savior, Breathe an Evening Blessing
049,1
049,Savior, breathe an evening blessing
049,Ere repose our spirits seal;
049,Sin and want we come confessing;
049,Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.
049,2
049,Though the night be dark and dreary
049,Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
049,Thou art He who, never weary
049,Watchest where Thy people be.
049,3
049,Though destruction walk around us.
049,Though the arrow past us fly
049,Angel guards from Thee Surround us
049,We are safe if Thou art nigh.
049,4
049,Should swift death this night o’re-take us
049,And our couch become our tomb
049,May the morn of glory wake us
049,Clad in light and deathless bloom.
050,050 – Abide With Me
050,1
050,Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
050,The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!
050,When other helpers fail and comforts flee
050,Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
050,2
050,Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
050,Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
050,Change and decay in all around I see;
050,O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
050,3
050,I need Thy presence every passing hour.
050,What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
050,Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
050,Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.
050,4
050,I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
050,Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
050,Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
050,I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!

051,Heart of love enfolding all
051,Through the glory and the grace
051,Of the stars that veil Thy face
051,Our hearts ascend.
051,4
051,When forever from our sight
051,Pass the stars, the day, the night

051,Let eternal morning rise
051,And shadows end.

053,2
053,Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son
053,the ill that I this day have done
053,that with the world, myself, and thee
053,I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.
053,3
053,O may my soul on thee repose
053,and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close
053,sleep that may me more vigorous make
053,to serve my God when I awake.
053,4
053,Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;

055,All this day Thy hand has led me
055,And I thank Thee for Thy care;
055,Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;
055,Listen to my evening prayer.
056,056 – The Day Thou Gavest
056,1
056,The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;
056,the darkness falls at Thy behest;
056,to Thee our morning hymns ascended;
056,Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.
056,2
056,We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping
056,while earth rolls onward into light
056,through all the world her watch is keeping
056,and rests not now by day or night.
056,3
056,As o’er each continent and island
056,the dawn leads on another day
056,the voice of prayer is never silent
056,nor die the strains of praise away.
056,4
056,So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never
056,like earth’s proud empires, pass away.

056,till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.

057,And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.
057,2
057,My Jesus, stay Thou by me
057,And let no foe come nigh me
057,Safe sheltered by Thy wing;
057,But would the foe alarm me
057,O let him never harm me
057,But still Thine angels round me sing!
057,3
057,My loved ones, rest securely
057,From every peril surely
057,Our God will guard your heads;

059,2
059,Precious is the tie that binds us
059,To our God when faith grows cold;

059,Faithful love serves to prove
059,Here the Shepherd has His fold.
059,3
059,May we learn from Christ’s example
059,How to use this house of prayer:

059,Wants us all to worship there.
059,God the Son shuts out none:
059,In His kingdom all may share.
059,4
059,Lord, inspire us with Your vision
059,Of a world which must be won!

086,When I look down
086,From lofty mountain grandeur
086,And see the brook and feel
086,the gentle breeze
086,3
086,And when I think
086,That God His Son not sparing
086,Sent Him to die
086,I scarce can take it in
086,That on the Cross
086,My burden gladly bearing
086,He bled and died
086,to take away my sin.

126,Thronged the air:
126,But His mother only
126,In her maiden bliss
126,Worshipped the beloved
126,With a kiss.

130,They bend on hovering wing
130,And ever o’er its Babel sounds
130,The blessed angels sing.

146,146 – I Think When I Read That Sweet Story
146,1
146,I think when I read that sweet story of old
146,When Jesus was here among men
146,How He called little children as lambs to His fold
146,I should like to have been with Him then.
146,2
146,I wish that His hands had been placed on my head
146,That His arm had been thrown around me
146,And that I might have seen His kind look when He said
146,“Let the little ones come unto Me.”
146,3
146,I long for the joy of that glorious time
146,The sweetest and brightest and best
146,When the dear little children of every clime
146,Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.

148,1
148,O love, how deep, how broad, how high
148,Beyond all thought and fantasy
148,That God, the Son of God, should take
148,Our mortal form for mortal’s sake!

148,For us the tempter overthrew.

149,149 – Once in Royal Davids City
149,1
149,Once in royal David’s city
149,Stood a lowly cattle shed
149,Where a mother laid her Baby
149,In a manger for His bed;
149,Mary was that mother mild
149,Jesus Christ her little Child.
149,2
149,He came down to earth from heaven
149,Who is God and Lord of all
149,And His shelter was a stable
149,And His cradle was a stall;
149,With the poor, and mean, and lowly
149,Lived on earth our Savior holy.
149,3
149,And through all His wondrous childhood
149,He would honor and obey
149,Love and watch the lowly mother
149,In whose gentle arms He lay.
149,Christian children all must be
149,Mild, obedient, good as He.
149,4
149,And our eyes at last shall see Him
149,Through His own redeeming love;
149,For that Child so dear and gentle
149,Is our Lord in heaven above;
149,And He leads His children on
149,To the place where He is gone.

150,4
150,Lo, at midnight, who is He
150,Prays in dark Gethsemane?
150,5
150,Who is He on yonder tree
150,Dies in shame and agony?
150,6
150,Who is He that from the grave
150,Comes to heal and help and save?

150,Rules through all the world alone?

154,When I survey the wondrous cross
154,on which the Prince of Glory died;
154,my richest gain I count but loss
154,and pour contempt on all my pride.
154,2
154,Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
154,save in the death of Christ, my God;
154,all the vain things that charm me most
154,I sacrifice them to his blood.
154,3
154,See, from his head, his hands, his feet
154,sorrow and love flow mingled down.

154,or thorns compose so rich a crown.

155,Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.
155,4
155,Were the whole realm of nature mine
155,That were a tribute far too small;

156,O sacred Head, now wounded
156,with grief and shame weighed down
156,now scornfully surounded
156,with thorns, thine only crown:

157,Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
157,Learn from him to bear the cross.

159,2
159,O that old rugged cross
159,so despised by the world
159,has a wondrous attraction for me;
159,for the dear Lamb of God
159,left his glory above
159,to bear it to dark Calvary.
159,3
159,To that old rugged cross
159,I will ever be true
159,its shame and reproach gladly bear;
159,then he’ll call me some day
159,to my home far away
159,where his glory forever I’ll share.

161,Till the Lamb of God may die.

161,Upward through the whelming cloud!
161,You, the Father’s only Son
161,You, His own anointed one
161,You are asking- can it be?
161,“Why have You forsaken Me?”
161,4
161,Lord, should fear and anguish roll
161,Darkly o’er our sinful soul
161,You, who once were thus bereft
161,That Your own might ne’er be left

163,163 – At the Cross
163,1

163,for sinners such as I?

163,At the cross, at the cross
163,where I first saw the light
163,and the burden of my heart rolled away;

163,and now I am happy all the day!
163,2
163,Was it for crimes that I have done
163,he groaned upon the tree?
163,Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
163,And love beyond degree!

164,What pains He had to bear
164,But we believe it was for us

164,He died that we might be forgiven
164,He died to make us good
164,That we might go at last to heaven
164,Saved by His precious blood.
164,4
164,There was no other good enough
164,To pay the price of sin;
164,He only could unlock the gate
164,Of heaven, and let us in.
164,5
164,O dearly, dearly has He loved!
164,And we must love Him too
164,And trust in His redeeming blood

168,The Lord of inter stellar space
168,And conqueror of time?

170,Jacob’s sons and daughters;
170,Led them with unmoistened foot
170,Through the Red Sea waters.
170,2
170,‘Tis the spring of souls today;
170,Christ has burst His prison
170,And from three days’sleep in death

170,Laud and praise undying.

170,Nor the watchers, nor the seal
170,Hold Him as a mortal.
170,5
170,“Alleluia!” now we cry
170,To our King immortal

177,With joy shall I lift up my head.

177,Bold shall I stand in that great day
177,Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
177,For by your cross absolved I am
177,From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.
177,3
177,Lord, I believe your precious blood
177,Which at the mercy seat of God
177,Pleads for the captives’ liberty
177,Was also shed in love for me.
177,4
177,When from the dust of death I rise
177,To claim my mansion in the skies
177,This then shall be my only plea:
177,Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
178,178 – The Unveiled Christ
178,1
178,Once our blessed Christ of beauty
178,Was veiled off from human views;
178,But through suffering, death, and sorrow
178,He has rent the veil in two.
178,Refrain
178,O behold the Man of Sorrows!
178,O behold Him in plain view!

179,179 – The Wonders of Redeeming Love
179,1
179,The wonders of redeeming love
179,Our highest thoughts exceed;
179,The Son of God comes from above
179,For sinful man to bleed.
179,2
179,He gives Himself, His life, His all
179,A sinless sacrifice.
179,For man He drains the cup of gall
179,For man the victim dies.
179,3
179,And now before His Father’s face
179,His precious blood He pleads;
179,For those who seek the throne of grace
179,His love still intercedes.
179,4
179,He knows the frailties of our frame
179,For He has borne our grief;
179,Our great High Priest once felt the same
179,And He can send relief.
179,5
179,His love will not be satisfied
179,Till He in glory sees
179,The faithful ones for whom He died
179,From sin forever free.

181,1

181,2
181,Does Jesus care when my way is dark
181,With a nameless dread and fear?
181,As the daylight fades into deep night shades
181,Does He care enough to be near?

181,To the dearest on earth to me
181,And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks ­

182,And lives, though ever crucified.

183,Earth or heaven can never know
183,How that sin as dark as mine
183,can be made as white as snow.
183,3
183,Nothing good for Him I’ve done;
183,How could He such love bestow?
183,Lord, I own my heart is won
183,help me now my love to show.
184,184 – Jesus Paid It All
184,1

184,“Thy strength indeed is small;
184,Child of weakness, watch and pray
184,Find in Me thine all in all.”
184,Refrain
184,Jesus paid it all
184,All to Him I owe;
184,Sin had left a crimson stain
184,He washed it white as snow.
184,2
184,Lord, now indeed I find
184,Thy power and Thine alone
184,Can change the leper’s spots
184,And melt the heart of stone.
184,3
184,Since nothing good have I
184,Whereby Thy grace to claim

186,186 – Ive Found a Friend
186,1
186,I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
186,He loved me ere I knew Him;

186,And thus He bound me to Him.
186,And ’round my heart still closely twine
186,Those ties which nought can sever
186,For I am His, and He is mine
186,Forever and forever.
186,2
186,I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
186,He bled, He died to save me;
186,And not alone the gift of life
186,But His own self He gave me.
186,Nought that I have my own I call
186,I hold it for the Giver;
186,My heart, my strength, my life my all
186,Are His, and His forever.
186,3
186,I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
186,All power to Him is given;

186,I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
186,So kind, and true, and tender

186,No; I am His forever.

187,He, my Strength, my victory wins.
187,3
187,Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!
187,While the billows over me roll
187,Even when my heart is breaking
187,He, my Comfort, helps my soul.

188,188 – My Song Is Love Unknown
188,1
188,My song is love unknown
188,My Savior’s love to me
188,Love to the loveless shown
188,That they might lovely be.
188,O who am I that for my sake
188,My Lord should take frail flesh and die?
188,2
188,He came from His blest throne
188,Salvation to bestow
188,But men made strange, and none
188,The longed for Christ would know.
188,But O my Friend, my Friend indeed
188,Who at my need His life did spend.
188,3
188,Sometimes they strew His way
188,And His sweet praises sing
188,Resounding all the day
188,Hosannas to their King.
188,Then “Crucify” is all their breath
188,And for His death they thirst and cry.
188,4
188,Why, what hath my Lord done?
188,What makes this rage and spite?
188,He made the lame to run
188,He gave the blind their sight.
188,Sweet injuries! yet they at these
188,Themselves displease, and ‘gainst Him rise.
188,5
188,They rise, and needs will have
188,My dear Lord made away;
188,A murderer they save
188,The Prince of life they slay.
188,Yet cheerful He to suff’ring goes
188,That He His foes from thence might free.
188,6
188,Here might I stay and sing
188,No story so divine:
188,Never was love, dear King
188,Never was grief like Thine!
188,This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise
188,I all my days could gladly spend.

189,All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
189,He is more than life to me; (to me;)
189,And the fairest of ten thousand
189,In my blessed Lord I see.
189,2
189,Love of Christ so freely given
189,Grace of God beyond degree
189,Mercy higher than the heaven
189,Deeper than the deepest sea.
189,3
189,Every need His hand supplying
189,Every good in Him I see;
189,On His strength divine relying
189,He is All in All to me.
189,4
189,By the crystal flowing river
189,With the ransomed I will sing
189,And forever and forever
189,Praise and glorify the King.

224,Of Thy word within us
224,And Thy kingdom’s power.

225,All we can do is nothing worth
225,Unless God blesses the deed;
225,Vainly we hope for the harvest tide
225,Till God gives life to the seed;
225,Yet nearer and nearer draws the time
225,The time that shall surely be
225,When the earth shall be filled
225,with the glory of God
225,As the waters cover the sea.

243,Thou hast spared me.
243,2
243,Wherefore with my utmost art
243,I will sing Thee
243,And the cream of all my heart
243,I will bring Thee.
243,Though my sins against me cried
243,Thou didst clear me;
243,And alone, when they replied
243,Thou didst hear me.
243,3
243,Seven whole days, not one in seven
243,I will praise Thee;
243,In my heart, though not in heav’n
243,I can raise Thee.
243,Small it is, in this poor sort
243,to enroll Thee:
243,Ev’n eternity’s too short
243,to extol Thee.

255,255 – I Cannot Tell Why
255,1
255,I cannot tell why
255,He whom angels worship
255,Should set His love
255,upon the souls of men
255,Or why as Shepherd
255,He should seek the wanderers
255,To bring them back
255,they know not how nor when.
255,But this I know
255,that He was born of Mary
255,When Bethlehem’s manger
255,was His only home
255,And that He lived
255,at Nazareth and labored;
255,And so the Savior
255,Savior of the world, has come.
255,2
255,I cannot tell how
255,silently He suffered
255,As with His peace
255,He graced this place of tears
255,Nor how His heart
255,upon the cross was broken
255,The crown of pain
255,to three and thirty years.
255,But this I know
255,He heals the broken hearted
255,And stays our sin
255,and calms our lurking fear
255,And lifts the burden
255,from the heavy laden;
255,For still the Savior
255,Savior of the world, is here.
255,3
255,I cannot tell how
255,He will win the nations
255,How He will claim
255,His earthly heritage
255,How satisfy the
255,needs and aspirations
255,Of east and west
255,of sinner and of sage.
255,But this I know
255,all flesh shall see His glory
255,And He shall reap
255,the harvest He has sown
255,And some glad day His
255,sun will shine in splendor
255,When He the Savior
255,Savior, of the world, is known.
255,4
255,I cannot tell how
255,all lands shall worship
255,When at His biding
255,every storm is stilled
255,Or who can say how
255,great the jubilation
255,When all our hearts
255,with love for Him are filled.
255,But this I know the skies
255,shall sound His praises
255,Ten thousand thousand
255,human voices sing

302,302 – Deeper Yet
302,1

303,1
303,Beneath the cross of Jesus
303,I fain would take my stand
303,the shadow of a mighty rock
303,within a weary land;
303,a home within the wilderness
303,a rest upon the way
303,from the burning of the noontide heat
303,and the burden of the day.
303,2
303,Upon that cross of Jesus
303,mine eye at times can see
303,the very dying form of One
303,who suffered there for me;
303,and from my stricken heart with tears
303,two wonders I confess:
303,the wonders of redeeming love
303,and my unworthiness.
303,3
303,I take, O cross, thy shadow
303,for my abiding place;
303,I ask no other sunshine than
303,the sunshine of his face;
303,content to let the world go by
303,to know no gain nor loss
303,my sinful self my only shame
303,my glory all the cross.

346,to sustain and renew
346,Hear as we pray that
346,today and each morrow
346,We to Thy purpose may
346,show ourselves true.
346,2

346,of preachers and prophets
346,Fearlessly speaking
346,the word of the Lord
346,Word of redemption
346,thro‘ God’s Son incarnate

347,347 – Built on the Rock
347,1
347,Built on the Rock the Church shall stand
347,Even when steeples are falling;
347,Crumbled have spires in every land
347,Bells still are chiming and calling
347,Calling the young and old to rest
347,Calling the souls of those distressed
347,Longing for life everlasting.
347,2
347,Not in our temples made with hands
347,God, the Almighty, is dwelling;
347,High in the heav’ns His temple stands
347,All earthly temples excelling.
347,Yet He who dwells in heav’n above
347,Deigns to abide with us in love
347,Making our bodies His temple.
347,3
347,We are God’s house of living stones
347,Built for His own habitation;
347,He fills our hearts, His humble thrones
347,Granting us life and salvation.
347,Were two or three to seek His face
347,He in their midst would show His grace
347,Blessings upon them bestowing.
347,4
347,Yet in this house, an earthly frame
347,Jesus His children is blessing;
347,Hither we come to praise His name
347,Faith in our Savior confessing.
347,Jesus to us His Spirit sent
347,Making with us His covenant
347,Granting His children the kingdom.
347,5
347,Thro‘ all the passing years, O Lord
347,Grant that, when church bells are ringing
347,Many may come to hear God’s Word
347,Where He this promise is bringing:
347,I know My own, My own know Me:
347,You, not the world, My face shall see;
347,My peace I leave with you. Amen.
348,348 – The Church Has One Foundation
348,1
348,The church’s one foundation
348,is Jesus Christ her Lord;
348,she is his new creation
348,by water and the Word.
348,From heaven he came and sought her
348,to be his holy bride;
348,with his own blood he bought her
348,and for her life he died.
348,2
348,Elect from every nation
348,yet one o’er all the earth;
348,her charter of salvation
348,one Lord, one faith, one birth;
348,one holy name she blesses
348,partakes one holy food
348,and to one hope she presses
348,with every grace endued.
348,3
348,Though with a scornful wonder
348,we see her sore oppressed
348,by schisms rent asunder
348,by heresies distressed
348,yet saints their watch are keeping;
348,their cry goes up, “How long?”
348,And soon the night of weeping
348,shall be the morn of song.
348,4
348,‘Mid toil and tribulation
348,and tumult of her war
348,she waits the consummation
348,of peace forevermore;
348,till, with the vision glorious
348,her longing eyes are blest
348,and the great church victorious
348,shall be the church at rest.

349,When we Christians gather,
349,members of one body
349,Let there be in us no
349,discord but one spirit.

349,strife, and every quarrel.
349,Christ, our God,
349,be always present here among us.
349,3
349,Grant us love’s fulfillment,
349,joy with all the blessed
349,When we see Your face,
349,O Savior, in its glory.
349,Shine on us,
349,O purest Light of all creation
349,Be our bliss while endless
349,ages sing Your praises.
350,350 – Blest Be the Tie That Binds
350,1
350,Blest be the tie that binds
350,our hearts in Christian love;
350,the fellowship of kindred minds
350,is like to that above.
350,2
350,Before our Father’s throne
350,we pour our ardent prayers;
350,our fears, our hopes, our aims are one
350,our comforts and our cares.
350,3
350,We share each other’s woes
350,our mutual burdens bear;
350,and often for each other flows
350,the sympathizing tear.
350,4
350,When we asunder part
350,it gives us inward pain;
350,but we shall still be joined in heart
350,and hope to meet again.
351,351 – Thy Hand, O God Has Guided
351,1
351,Thy hand, O God, has guided
351,Thy flock from age to age;
351,The wondrous tale is written
351,Full clear on every page;
351,Our fathers owned Thy goodness
351,And we their deeds record;
351,And both of this bear witness
351,One church, one faith, one Lord.
351,2
351,Thy heralds brought glad tidings
351,To greatest as to least;
351,They bade men rise and hasten
351,To share the great King’s feast:
351,And this was all their teaching
351,In every deed and word
351,To all alike proclaiming
351,One church, one faith, one Lord.
351,3
351,When shadows thick were falling
351,And all seemed sunk in night
351,Thou, Lord, did send Thy servants
351,Thy chosen sons of light.
351,On them and on Thy people
351,Thy plenteous grace was poured
351,And this was still their message:
351,One church, one faith, one Lord.
351,4
351,Thy mercy will not fail us
351,Nor leave Thy work undone;
351,With Thy right hand to help us
351,The vict’ry shall be won;
351,And then by men and angels
351,Thy name shall be adored
351,And this shall be their anthem:
351,One church, one faith, one Lord.

352,What I command that you should do.
352,3
352,You chose not Me, but I chose you
352,That you should go and bear much fruit.

353,2
353,Lord of desk and altar, bind our lives in one
353,That in work and worship love may set the tone.
353,Give us grace to listen, clarity of speech;
353,Make us truly thankful for the gifts of each.
353,3
353,Holy is the setting of each room and yard
353,Lecture hall and kitchen, office, shop, and ward.
353,Holy is the rhythm of our working hours;
353,Hallow then our purpose, energy, and pow’rs.
353,4
353,Strengthen, Lord, for service hand and heart and brain;
353,Help us good relations daily to maintain.
353,Let the living presence of the servant Christ

354,2
354,From out the darkness of our hope’s frustration
354,From all the broken idols of our pride
354,We turn to seek Thy truth’s illumination
354,And find Thy mercy waiting at our side.
354,3
354,In pity look upon Thy children’s striving
354,For life and freedom, peace and brotherhood
354,Till at the fullness of Thy truth arriving
354,We find in Christ the crown of every good.
354,4
354,Inspire Thy church, mid earth’s discordant voices
354,To preach the gospel of her Lord above
354,Until the day this warring world rejoices
354,To hear the mighty harmonies of love.

355,above the noise of selfish strife
355,we hear your voice, O Son of Man.
355,2
355,From tender childhood’s helplessness
355,from woman’s grief, man’s burdened toil
355,from famished souls, from sorrow’s stress
355,your heart has never known recoil.

355,The cup of water given for you still
355,holds the freshness of your grace;

355,make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
355,among these restless throngs abide;

356,4
356,Risen Lord, shall yet the city
356,Be the city of despair?
356,Come today, our judge, our glory;

357,357 – Come, Labor On
357,1
357,Come, labor on.
357,Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain
357,While all around him waves the golden grain?
357,And to each servant does the Master say
357,“Go work today.”
357,2
357,Come, labor on.
357,Claim the high calling angels cannot share;
357,To young and old the gospel gladness bear;
357,Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
357,The night draws nigh.
357,3
357,Come, labor on.
357,No time for rest; till glows the western sky
357,Till the long shadows oér our pathway lie
357,And a glad sound comes with the setting sun
357,“Well done, well done!”

358,Ere the harvest-time pass by.

358,Send them forth with morn’s first beaming
358,Send them in the noon-tides’s glare;
358,When the sun’s last rays are streaming
358,bid them gather everywhere.
358,3
358,O thou, whom thy Lord is sending
358,gather now the sheaves of gold;
358,Heavenward then at evening wending
358,Thou shalt come with joy untold.

359,1
359,Hark! the voice of Jesus calling
359,“Who will go and work today?
359,Fields are white, the harvest waiting
359,Who will bear the sheaves away?”
359,Loud and long the Master calleth
359,Rich reward He offers free;
359,Who will answer, gladly saying
359,“Here am I, O Lord, send me”?
359,2
359,If you cannot cross the ocean
359,And the heathen lands explore
359,You can find the heathen nearer
359,You can help them at your door;
359,If you cannot speak like angels
359,If you cannot preach like Paul
359,You can tell the love of Jesus
359,You can say He died for all.
359,3
359,If you cannot be the watchman
359,Standing high on Zion’s wall
359,Pointing out the path to heaven
359,Offering life and peace to all;
359,With your prayers and with your bounties
359,You can do what Heaven demands
359,You can be like faithful Aaron
359,Holding up the prophet’s hands.
359,4
359,While the souls of men are dying
359,And the Master calls for you
359,Let none hear you idly saying
359,“There is nothing I can do!”
359,Gladly take the task He gives you
359,Let His work your pleasure be;
359,Answer quickly when He calleth
359,“Here am I, O Lord, send me.”

361,Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?
361,3

363,Every gift which You impart.
363,2
363,Still Your children wander homeless;
363,Still the hungry cry for bread;
363,Still the captives long for freedom;
363,Still in grief we mourn our dead.

363,Healed the sick and freed the soul
363,By Your Spirit send Your power
363,To our world to make it whole.

396,We come with self inflicted pains
396,Of broken trust and chosen wrong
396,Half free, half bound by inner chains
396,By social forces swept along
396,By powers and systems close confined
396,Yet seeking hope for human kind.
396,3

396,But by Your gracious love alone.

396,And find You kneeling at our feet.

396,Then take the towel, and break the bread
396,And humble us, and call us friends.

396,And show how grandly love intends
396,To work till all creation sings
396,To fill all worlds, to crown all things.

396,Your life to live, Your joy to share.

396,And offer all that faith can do
396,While love is making all things new.

421,2
421,Thou wast their Rock
421,their Fortress and their Might;

421,Thou, in the darkness drear
421,their one true light.
421,Alleluia!
421,Alleluia!
421,3
421,O may Thy soldiers
421,faithful, true, and bold

421,and arms are strong.
421,Alleluia!

422,422 – Marching to Zion
422,1
422,Come, we that love the Lord
422,And let our joys be known;
422,Join in a song with sweet accord
422,Join in a song with sweet accord
422,And thus surround the throne
422,And thus surround the throne.
422,Refrain
422,We’re marching to Zion
422,Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
422,We’re marching upward to Zion
422,The beautiful city of God.
422,2
422,Let those refuse to sing
422,Who never knew our God;
422,But children of the heavenly King
422,But children of the heavenly King
422,May speak their joys abroad
422,May speak their joys abroad.
422,3
422,The hill of Zion yields
422,A thousand sacred sweets
422,Before we reach the heavenly fields
422,Before we reach the heavenly fields
422,Or walk the golden streets
422,Or walk the golden streets.
422,4
422,Then let our songs abound
422,And every tear be dry;
422,We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
422,We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
422,To fairer worlds on high
422,To fairer worlds on high.
423,423 – Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken
423,1
423,Glorious things of thee are spoken
423,Zion, city of our God;
423,He whose word cannot be broken
423,Formed thee for His own abode;
423,On the Rock of Ages founded
423,What can shake thy sure repose?
423,With salvation’s wall surrounded
423,Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.
423,2
423,See the streams of living waters
423,Springing from eternal love
423,Well supply thy sons and daughters
423,And all fear and want remove;
423,Who can faint when such a river
423,Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
423,Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver
423,Never fails from age to age.
423,3
423,Round each habitation hovering
423,See the cloud and fire appear
423,For a glory and a covering
423,Showing that the Lord is near;
423,Blest inhabitants of Zion
423,Washed in the Redeemer’s blood;
423,Jesus, whom their souls rely on
423,Makes them kings and priests to God.
423,4
423,Savior, if of Zion’s city
423,I, through grace, a member am
423,Let the world deride or pity
423,I will glory in Thy name;
423,Fading is the worldling’s pleasure
423,All his boasted pomp and show;
423,Solid joys and lasting treasure
423,None but Zion’s children know.
424,424 – For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country
424,1
424,For thee, O dear country
424,Mine eyes their vigils keep;
424,For very love beholding
424,Thy holy name, they weep.
424,2
424,O one, O only mansion!
424,O Paradise of joy!
424,Where tears are ever banish’d
424,And smiles have no alloy;
424,3
424,With jasper glow thy burwarks
424,Thy streets with emeralds blaze;
424,The sardius and the topaz
424,Unite in thee their rays;
424,4
424,The cross is all thy splendor
424,The Crucified thy praise;
424,His laud and benediction
424,Thy ransom’d saints shall raise;
424,5
424,O sweet and blessed country
424,The home of God’s elect!
424,O sweet and blessed country
424,That eager hearts expect!
425,425 – Holy, Holy, Is What the Angels Sing
425,1
425,There is singing up in heaven
425,such as we have never known
425,Where the angels sing the praises
425,of the Lamb upon the throne;
425,Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
425,and their voices are always clear
425,O that we might be more like them
425,while we serve the Master here!
425,Refrain
425,Holy, holy, is what the angels sing
425,And I expect to help them make
425,the courts of heaven ring;
425,But when I sing redemption’s story
425,they will fold their wings
425,For angels never felt the joys
425,that our salvation brings.
425,2
425,But I hear another anthem
425,blending voices clear and strong
425,“Unto Him who hath redeemed us
425,and hath bought us,” is the song;
425,We have come thro’ tribulations
425,to this land so fair and bright
425,In the fountain freely flowing
425,He hath made our garments white.
425,3
425,Then the angels stand and listen
425,for they cannot join that song
425,Like the sound of many waters
425,by that happy, blood-washed throng;
425,For they sing about great trials
425,battles fought and vict’ries won
425,And they praised the great Redeemer
425,who hath said to them, “Well done.”
425,4
425,So, although I’m not an angel
425,yet I know that over there
425,I will join a blessed chorus
425,that the angels cannot share;
425,I will sing about my Savior
425,who upon dark Calvary
425,Freely pardoned my transgressions
425,died to set the sinner free.
426,426 – I Shall See the King
426,1
426,I shall see the King where the angels sing
426,I shall see the King some day, in the better land
426,On that golden strand
426,And with Him shall ever stay.
426,Refrain
426,In His glory, I shall see the King
426,And forever endless praises sing;
426,‘Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
426,I shall see the King someday.
426,2
426,In the land of song, in the glory throng
426,Where there never comes a night
426,With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
426,In the glory land of light.
426,3
426,I shall see the King, all my tributes bring
426,And shall look upon His face;
426,Then my song shall be how He ransomed me
426,And has kept me by His grace.
427,427 – No Night There
427,1
427,In the land of fadeless day
427,Lies “the city four-square;”
427,It shall never pass away
427,And there is “no night there.”
427,Refrain
427,God shall “wipe away all tears;”
427,There’s no death, no pain, nor fears;
427,And they count not time by years
427,For there is “no night there.”
427,2
427,All the gates of pearl are made
427,In “the city four-square;”
427,All the streets with gold are laid
427,And there is “no night there.”
427,3
427,And the gates shall never close
427,To “the city four-square;”
427,There life’s crystal river flows
427,And there is “no night there.”
427,4
427,There they need no sunshine bright
427,In “that city four-square;”
427,For the Lamb is all the light
427,And there is “no night there.”
428,428 – Sweet By and By
428,1
428,There’s a land that is fairer than day
428,And by faith we can see it afar;
428,For the Father waits over the way
428,To prepare us a dwelling place there.
428,Refrain
428,In the sweet in the sweet
428,By and by by and by
428,We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
428,In the sweet in the sweet
428,By and by by and by
428,We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
428,2
428,We shall sing on that beautiful shore
428,The melodious songs of the blest
428,And our spirits shall sorrow no more
428,Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.
428,3
428,To our bountiful father above
428,We will offer our tribute of praise;
428,For the glorious gift of His love
428,And the blessings that hallow our days.
429,429 – Jerusalem the Golden
429,1
429,Jerusalem the golden
429,With milk and honey blest
429,Beneath thy contemplation
429,Sink heart and voice oppressed.
429,I know not, O I know not
429,What holy joys are there;
429,What radiancy of glory
429,What bliss beyond compare.
429,2
429,They stand, those hall of Zion
429,All jubilant with song
429,And bright with many an angel
429,And all the martyr throng.
429,The Prince is ever in them
429,The daylight is serene;
429,The pastures of the blessed
429,Are deck in glorious sheen.
429,3
429,There is the throne of David
429,And there, from care released
429,The shout of them that triumph
429,The song of them that feast;
429,And they who, with their Leader
429,Have conquered in the fight
429,Forever and forever
429,Are clad in robes of white.
429,4
429,O sweet and blessed country
429,The home of God’s elect!
429,O sweet and blessed country
429,That eager hearts expect!
429,Jesus, in mercy bring us
429,To that dear land of rest;
429,Who art, with God the Father
429,And Spirit, ever blest.
430,430 – Joy By and By
430,1
430,O there’ll be joy when the work is done
430,Joy when the reapers gather home
430,Bringing the sheaves at set of sun
430,To the New Jerusalem.
430,Refrain
430,Joy, joy, joy, there’ll be joy by and by
430,Joy, joy, joy, where the joys never die;
430,Joy, joy, joy, for the day draweth nigh
430,When the workers gather home.
430,2
430,Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing
430,Grateful the thanks our hearts shall bring
430,Praising forever Christ our King
430,In the New Jerusalem.
430,3
430,Pure are the joys that await us there
430,Many the golden mansions fair;
430,Jesus Himself doth them prepare
430,In the New Jerusalem.
431,431 – Over Yonder
431,1
431,Come let us sing of homeland
431,Down by the crystal sea;
431,Wonderful land where Jesus
431,Buildeth a mansion for me.
431,Refrain
431,Over yonder, down by the crystal sea
431,down              by the crystal sea
431,Over yonder, there’s where I long to be
431,There’s            where I long to be
431,No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care
431,In the homeland bright and fair
431,Over, over there.
431,Over there.
431,2
431,Water of life there floweth
431,Fruit in abundant store;
431,Citizens of that country
431,Hunger and thirst never more.
431,3
431,Come go with me to homeland
431,Jesus invites you there;
431,Help spread the invitation
431,Tell it to men everywhere.
432,432 – Shall We Gather at the River
432,1
432,Shall we gather at the river
432,where bright angel feet have trod
432,with its crystal tide forever
432,flowing by the throne of God?
432,Refrain
432,Yes, we’ll gather at the river
432,the beautiful, the beautiful river;
432,gather with the saints at the river
432,that flows by the throne of God.
432,2
432,On the margin of the river
432,washing up its silver spray
432,we will walk and worship ever
432,all the happy golden day.
432,3
432,Ere we reach the shining river
432,lay we every burden down;
432,grace our spirits will deliver
432,and provide a robe and crown.
432,4
432,Soon we’ll reach the shining river
432,soon our pilgrimage will cease;
432,soon our happy hearts will quiver
432,with the melody of peace.
433,433 – Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand
433,1
433,Ten thousand times ten thousand
433,In sparkling raiment bright
433,The armies of the ransomed saints
433,Throng up the steeps of light.
433,‘Tis finished, all is finished
433,Their fight with death and sin.
433,Fling open wide the golden gates
433,And let the victors in.
433,2
433,What rush of hallelujahs
433,Fills all the earth and sky!
433,The ringing of a thousand harps
433,Proclaims the triumph high.
433,O day for which creation
433,And all its tribes were made!
433,O joy, for all its former woes
433,A thousandfold repaid!
433,3
433,O then what raptured greetings
433,On Canaan’s happy shore!
433,What knitting severed friendship where
433,Death partings are no more!
433,Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
433,That brimmed with tears of late;
433,Orphans no longer fatherless
433,Nor widows desolate.
433,4
433,Bring near Thy great salvation
433,Thou Lamb for sinners slain
433,Fill up the roll of Thine elect
433,Then take Thy power and reign!
433,Appear, Desire of nations
433,Thine exiles long for home;
433,Show in the heavens Thy promised sign;
433,Thou Prince and Savior come!
434,434 – We Speak of the Realms
434,1
434,We speak of the realms of the blest
434,That country so bright and so fair
434,And oft are its glories confessed-
434,But what must it be to be there!
434,We speak of its pathway of gold-
434,Its walls decked with jewels so rare
434,Its wonders and pleasures untold-
434,But what must it be to be there!
434,2
434,We speak of its freedom of sin
434,From sorrow, temptation and care
434,From trials without and within—
434,But what must it be to be there!
434,We speak of its service of love
434,Of the robes which glorified wear
434,Of the church of the First Born above-
434,But what must it be to be there!
434,3
434,Our mourning is all at an end
434,When, raised by the life-giving word
434,We see the new city descend
434,Adorned as a bride for her Lord;
434,The city so holy and clean
434,No sorrow can breathe in the air;
434,No gloom of affliction or sin
434,No shadow of evil, is there.
434,4
434,Do Thou, midst temptation and woe
434,For heaven my spirit prepare;
434,And shortly I also so shall know
434,And feel what it is to be there.
434,Then o’er the bright fields we shall roam
434,In glory celestial and fair
434,With saints and with angels at home
434,And Jesus Himself will be there.
435,435 – The Glory Song
435,1
435,When all my labors and trails are o’er
435,And I am safe on that beautiful shore
435,Just to be near the Lord I adore
435,Will through the ages be glory for me.
435,Refrain
435,O that will be
435,O      that will
435,Glory for me, Glory for me
435,Be    glory for me,    Glory for me
435,Glory for me; When by His grace
435,Glory for me;
435,I shall look on His face
435,That will be glory, be glory for me.
435,2
435,When, by the gift of His infinite grace
435,I am accorded in heaven a place
435,Just to be there and to look on His face
435,Will through the ages be glory for me.
435,3
435,Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
435,Joy like a river around me will flow
435,Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know
435,Will through the ages be glory for me.
436,436 – The Homeland
436,1
436,The homeland! O the homeland!
436,The land of the free born!
436,There’s no night in the homeland
436,But aye the fadeless morn;
436,I’m sighing for homeland
436,My heart is aching here;
436,There is no pain in the homeland
436,To which I’m drawing near;
436,There is no pain in the homeland
436,To which I’m drawing near.
436,2
436,My Lord is in the homeland
436,With angels bright and fair;
436,There’s no sin in the homeland
436,And no temptation there;
436,The music of the homeland
436,Is ringing in my ears;
436,And when I think of the homeland
436,My eyes are filled with tears;
436,And when I think of the homeland
436,My ears are filled with tears.
436,3
436,The dwellers in the homeland
436,Are beckoning me to come
436,Where neither death nor sorrow
436,Invades their holy name;
436,O dear, dear native country!
436,O rest and peace above!

436,Of Thy redeeming love;
436,Christ bring us all to the homeland
436,Of Thy redeeming love
437,437 – Im Going Home
437,1
437,My heav’nly home is bright and fair
437,Nor pain nor death can enter there;
437,It’s glitt’ring tow’rs the sun outshine
437,That heav’nly mansion shall me mine.
437,Refrain
437,I’m going home, I’m going home
437,I’m going home to die no more;
437,To die no more; to die no more-
437,I’m going home to die no more.
437,2
437,My Father’s house is built on high
437,Far, far above the starry sky;
437,When from this earthly prison free
437,That heav’nly mansion mine shall be.
437,3
437,Let others seek a home below
437,Which flames devour or waves oe’r flow;
437,Be mine a happier lot to own
437,A heav’nly mansion near the throne.

438,You will see your Lord a-coming
438,You will see your Lord a-coming
438,You will see your Lord a-coming
438,In a few more days.

438,Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over
438,In a few more days.
439,439 – How Far From Home
439,1
439,How far from? I asked, as on
439,I bent my steps-the watchman spake:
439,“the long, dark night is almost gone
439,The morning soon will break.
439,Then weep no more, but speed thy flight
439,With Hope’s bright star guiding ray
439,Till thou shalt reach the realms of light
439,In everlasting days.”
439,2
439,I asked the warrior on the field;
439,This was his soul-inspiring song:
439,“With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield
439,The battle is not long.
439,Then weep no more, but well endure
439,The conflict, till thy work is done;
439,For this we know, the prize is sure
439,When victory is won.”
439,3
439,I asked again; earth, sea, and sun
439,Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
439,“Time’s wasting sands are nearly run
439,Eternity is nigh.
439,Then weep no more-with warning tones
439,Portentous signs are thickening round
439,The whole creation, waiting, groans
439,To hear the trumpet sound.”
439,4
439,Not far from home! O blessed thought!
439,The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;
439,Which oft a healing balm has brought
439,And dried the mourner’s tear.
439,Then weep no more, since we shall meet
439,Where weary footsteps never roam-
439,Our trails past, our joys complete
439,Safe in our Father’s home.
440,440 – How Cheering Is the Christians Hope
440,1
440,How cheering is the Christian’s hope
440,While toiling here below!
440,It bouys us up while this passing through
440,This wilderness of woe
440,2
440,It bouys us up while this passing through
440,This wilderness of woe
440,It bouys us up while passing through
440,This wilderness of woe.
440,3
440,It points us to a land of rest
440,Where saints with Christ will reign;
440,Where we shall meet the loved of earth
440,And never part again.
440,4
440,Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly
440,Dear Savior, quickly come!
440,We long to see Thee as Thou art
440,And reach that blissful home.
441,441 – I Saw One Weary
441,1
441,I saw one weary, sad, and torn
441,With eager steps press on the way
441,Who long the hallowed cross had born
441,Still looking for the promised day;
441,While many a line of grief and care
441,Upon his brow was furrowed there;
441,I asked what buoyed his spirits up
441,“O this” said he-“the blessed hope.”
441,2
441,And one I saw, with sword and shield
441,Who boldly braved the world’s cold frown
441,And fought, unyielding, on the field
441,To win an everlasting crown.
441,Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes
441,No murmur from his heart arose;
441,I asked what buoyed his spirits up
441,“O this!” said he-“the blessed hope.”
441,3
441,And there was one who left behind
441,The cherished friends of early years
441,And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed

441,Yet still a smile of joy he wore;
441,O! what can bouy the spirit up?
441,‘Tis this alone-the blessed hope.
441,4
441,While pilgrims here we journey on
441,In this dark vale of sin and gloom
441,Through tribulation, hate, and scorn
441,Or through the portals of the tomb
441,Till our returning King shall come
441,To tkae His exile captives home

453,No longer are homeless ones;
453,And we know that the goodly land is fair
453,Where life’s pure river runs.
453,2
453,They say green fields are waving there
453,That never a blight shall know;
453,And the deserts wild are blooming fair
453,And the roses of Sharon grow.

453,Their songs are blithe and sweet;
453,And their warblings, gushing ever new
453,The angels’ harpings greet.

455,Is by our beds of pain;
455,We touch Him in life’s throng and press
455,And we are whole again.

455,Our lips of childhood frame;

466,Passing down the rough pathway of time!

468,An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.
468,4
468,A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
468,They’re building a palace for me over there;

488,And next I prayed for strength:
488,That I might tread the road
488,With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
488,The heaven’s serene abode.
488,3
488,And then I asked for faith:
488,Could I but trust my God
488,I’d live infolded in His peace
488,Though foes were all abroad.
488,4
488,But now I pray for love:
488,Deep love to God and man;
488,A living love that will not fail
488,However dark His plan.
488,5
488,And light and strength and faith
488,Are opening everywhere!
488,God waited patiently until
488,I prayed the larger prayer.
489,489 – Jesus, Lover of My Soul
489,1
489,Jesus, lover of my soul
489,Let me to thy bosom fly

489,Till the storm of life is past;

489,Vile and full of sin I am;
489,Thou art full of truth and grace.
489,4
489,Plenteous grace with Thee is found-
489,Grace to pardon all my sin;
489,Let the healing streams abound
489,Make and keep me pure within;

489,Freely let me take of Thee;

491,491 – In the Hour of Trial
491,1
491,In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me
491,Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
491,When Thou see’st me waver, with a look recall
491,Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.
491,2
491,With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
491,Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
491,Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane
491,Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.
491,3
491,Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe
491,Or should pain attend me on my path below
491,Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;
491,Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
492,492 – Like Jesus
492,1
492,Teach, me, Father, what to say;
492,Teach me, Father, how to pray;
492,Teach me all along the way
492,How to be like Jesus.
492,Refrain
492,I would be like Jesus
492,I would be like Jesus!
492,Help me, Lord, to daily grow
492,More and more like Jesus!
492,2
492,Teach me as the days go by
492,Teach me not to reason why
492,Teach me that to do and die
492,Is to be like Jesus.
492,3
492,Teach me that the time is short
492,Teach me how to live and work
492,Teach me that to never shirk
492,Is to be like Jesus.

492,Like the Father and the Son;
492,And when all is overcome
492,I will be like Jesus.
493,493 – Fill My Cup, Lord
493,1
493,Like the woman at the well I was seeking
493,For things that could not satisfy:
493,And then I heard my Savior speaking:
493,” Draw from my well that never shall run dry”.
493,Refrain
493,Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
493,Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
493,Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–
493,Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
493,2
493,There are millions in this world who are craving
493,The pleasures earthly things afford;
493,But none can match the wondrous treasure
493,That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.
493,3
493,So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
493,Leave hungers that won’t pass away
493,My blessed Lord will come and save you
493,If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:
494,494 – We Would See Jesus
494,1
494,“We would see Jesus;” for the shadows lengthen
494,Across the little landscape of our life;
494,We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
494,For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.
494,2
494,“We would see Jesus,” Rock of our salvation
494,Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;
494,Not life, nor death, with all their agitation
494,Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.
494,3
494,“We would see Jesus;” other lights are paling
494,Which for long years we did rejoice to see;
494,The blessings of this sinful world are failing;
494,We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.
494,4
494,“We would see Jesus;” this is all we’re needing-
494,Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;
494,We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading
494,Soon to return and end this mortal night!
495,495 – Near to the Heart of God
495,1
495,There is a place of quiet rest
495,near to the heart of God;
495,a place where sin cannot molest
495,near to the heart of God.

495,O Jesus, blest Redeemer
495,sent from the heart of God
495,hold us who wait before thee
495,near to the heart of God.
495,2
495,There is a place of comfort sweet
495,near to the heart of God;
495,a place where we our Savior meet
495,near to the heart of God.
495,3
495,There is place a place of full release
495,near to the heart of God;
495,a place where all is joy and peace
495,near to the heart of God.
496,496 – Eternal Love, We Have No Good
496,1
496,Eternal Love, we have no good to bring Thee
496,No single good of all our hands have wrought
496,No worthy music have we found to sing Thee
496,No jewelled word, no quick up soaring thought.
496,2
496,And yet we come; and when our faith would falter
496,Show us, O Love, the quiet place of prayer
496,The golden censer and the golden altar
496,And the great angel waiting for us there.
497,497 – O Gracious Father of Mankind
497,1
497,O gracious Father of mankind
497,Our spirits’ unseen friend;
497,High heaven’s Lord, our hearts’ dear guest
497,To Thee our prayers ascend.
497,2
497,Thou dost not wait till human speech
497,Thy gifts divine implore;
497,Our dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
497,Are prayers Thou lovest more.
497,3
497,Thou hearest these, the good and ill
497,Deep buried in each breast;
497,The secret thought, the hidden plan
497,Wrought out our unexpressed.
497,4
497,O cleanse our prayers from human dross
497,Attune our lives to Thee
497,Until we labor for those gifts
497,We ask on bended knee.
497,5
497,Our best is but Thyself in us
497,Our highest thought Thy will;
497,To hear Thy voice we need but love
497,And listen, and be still.
497,6
497,We would not bend Thy will to ours
497,But blend our wills to Thine;
497,Not dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
497,Are prayers Thou lovest more.
497,7
497,Thou seekest us in love and truth
497,More than our minds seek Thee;
497,Through open gates Thy power flows in
497,Like flood tides from the sea.
497,8
497,No more we seek Thee from afar
497,Nor ask Thee for a sign
497,Content to pray in life and love
497,And toil, till all are Thine.
498,498 – Still, Still With Thee
498,1
498,Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh
498,When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
498,Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight
498,Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.
498,2
498,Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows
498,The solemn hush of nature newly born;
498,Alone with Thee in breathless adoration
498,In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.
498,3
498,Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning
498,A fresh and solemn splendor still is given
498,So does this blessed consciousness, awaking
498,Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.
498,4
498,So shall it be at last, in that bright morning
498,When the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee;
498,O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning
498,Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.
499,499 – What a Friend We Have in Jesus
499,1
499,What a friend we have in Jesus
499,All our sins and griefs to bear!
499,What a privilege to carry
499,Everything to God in prayer!
499,Oh, what peace we often forfeit;
499,Oh, what needless pain we bear
499,All because we do not carry
499,Everything to God in prayer!
499,2
499,Have we trials and temptations?
499,Is there trouble anywhere?
499,We should never be discouraged
499,Take it to the Lord in prayer.

499,Who will all our sorrows share?
499,Jesus knows our every weakness
499,Take it to the Lord in prayer.
499,3
499,Are we weak and heavy laden
499,Cumbered with a load of care?
499,Precious Savior, still our refuge
499,Take it to the Lord in prayer.
499,Do your friends despise, forsake you?
499,Take it to the Lord in prayer.
499,In his arms he’ll take and shield you;
499,You will find a solace there.
500,500 – Take Time to Be Holy
500,1
500,Take time to be holy
500,speak oft with thy Lord;
500,abide in him always
500,and feed on his word.
500,Make friends of God’s children
500,help those who are weak
500,forgetting in nothing
500,his blessing to seek.
500,2
500,Take time to be holy
500,the world rushes on;
500,spend much time in secret
500,with Jesus alone.
500,By looking to Jesus
500,like him thou shalt be;
500,thy friends in thy conduct
500,his likeness shall see.

500,for service above.
501,501 – Tis the Blessed Hour of Prayer
501,1
501,‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend
501,And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
501,If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share
501,Refrain
501,What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
501,Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer
501,What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
501,2
501,‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near
501,With a tender compassion His children to hear;
501,When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care
501,3
501,‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
501,To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;
501,With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;
501,4
501,‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe
501,That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;
501,In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
502,502 – Sun of My Soul
502,1
502,Sun of my soul, O Savior dear!
502,It is not night if Thou be near;
502,O may no earth-born cloud arise
502,To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes.
502,2
502,When soft the dews of kindly sleep
502,My weary eyelids gently steep
502,Be my last thought how sweet to rest
502,Forever on my Savior’s breast!
502,3
502,Abide with me from morn till eve
502,For without Thee I cannot live;
502,Abide with me when night is nigh
502,For without Thee I dare not die.
502,4
502,Be near and bless me when I wake
502,Ere through the world my way I take;
502,Till in the ocean of Thy love
502,I lose myself in heaven above.
503,503 – A Quiet Place
503,1
503,There is a quiet place
503,Far from the rapid pace
503,where God can soothe my troubled mind.
503,Sheltered by tree and flow’r
503,There in my quiet hour with Him
503,my cares are left behind.
503,Whether a garden small
503,Or on a mountain tall
503,New strength and courage there I find;
503,Then from this quiet place
503,I go prepared to face a new day
503,With love for all mankind.
504,504 – Lord Jesus, Think on Me
504,1
504,Lord Jesus, think on me
504,And purge away my sin;
504,From earth-born passions set me free
504,And make me pure within.

504,To Father, Spirit, and to Thee
504,The strains of praise and love.

505,To bear my tempted soul above
505,And intercede with God for me;

505,I need the prayers of those I love
505,To help me in each trying hour
505,To bear my tempted sould to Him
505,That He may keep me by His pow’r.

505,To hold me up on wing of faith
505,That I may walk the narrow way
505,Kept by our Father’s glorious grace.
506,506 – A Mighty Fortress
506,1
506,A mighty fortress is our God
506,a bulwark never failing;
506,our helper he amid the flood
506,of mortal ills prevaling.
506,For still our ancient foe
506,doth seek to work us woe;
506,his craft and power are great
506,and armed with cruel hate
506,on earth is not his equal.
506,2
506,Did we in our own strength confide
506,our striving would be losing
506,were not the right man on our side
506,the man of God’s own choosing.
506,Dost ask who that may be?
506,Christ Jesus, it is he;
506,Lord Sabbaoth, his name
506,from age to age the same
506,and he must win the battle.
506,3
506,And though this world, with devils filled
506,should threaten to undo us
506,we will not fear, for God hath willed
506,his truth to triumph through us.
506,The Prince of Darkness grim
506,we tremble not for him;
506,his rage we can endure
506,for lo, his doom is sure;
506,one little word shall fell him.
506,4
506,That word above all earthly powers
506,no thanks to them, abideth;
506,the Spirit and the gifts are ours
506,thru him who with us sideth.
506,Let goods and kindred go
506,this mortal life also;
506,the body they may kill;
506,God’s truth abideth still;
506,his kingdom is forever.
507,507 – Moment by Moment
507,1

507,Never a burden that He doth not bear
507,Never a sorrow that He doth not share
507,Moment by moment I’m under His care.
507,3
507,Never a heart-ache, and never a groan
507,Never a teardrop and never a moan;

507,Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
507,4
507,Never a weakness that He doth not feel
507,Never a sickness that He cannot heal;

508,Refrain
508,Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
508,Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
508,2
508,Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
508,Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
508,Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways
508,Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
508,3
508,Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep
508,When the darkening shadows round about me creep
508,Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
508,Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
509,509 – How Firm a Foundation
509,1
509,How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
509,is laid for your faith in his excellent word!

509,to you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
509,2
509,“Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed
509,for I am thy God and will still give thee aid;
509,I’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand
509,upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.”
509,3
509,“When through deep waters I call thee to go
509,the rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;
509,for I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless
509,and sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.”
509,4
509,“When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
509,my grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply;
509,the flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
509,thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.”
509,5
509,“The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for respose
509,I will not, I will not depart to His foes;
509,That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
509,I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!”

510,1
510,If you but trust in God to guide you
510,And place your confidence in Him
510,You’ll find Him always there beside you
510,To give you hope and strength within.
510,For those who trust God’s changeless love
510,Build on the rock that will not move.
510,2
510,What gain is there in futile weeping
510,In helpless anger and distress?
510,If you are in His care and keeping
510,In sorrow will He love you less?
510,For He who took for you a cross
510,Will bring you safe through every loss.
510,3
510,In patient trust await His leisure
510,In cheerful hope, with heart content
510,To take whate’er your Father’s pleasure
510,And all discerning love have sent;
510,Doubt not your inmost wants are known
510,To Him who chose you for His own.
510,4
510,Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving
510,Offer your service faithfully
510,And trust His word; though undeserving
510,You’ll find His promise true to be.

511,1
511,I know not why God’s wondrous grace
511,To me He hath made known
511,Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
511,Redeemed me for His own.
511,Refrain
511,But “I know whom I have believed
511,and am persuaded that His is able
511,To keep that which I’ve committed
511,Unto Him against that day.”
511,2
511,I know not how this saving faith
511,To me He did impart
511,Nor how believing in His word
511,Wrought peace within my heart.
511,3
511,I know not how the Spirit moves
511,Convincing men of sin
511,Revealing Jesus through the word

533,Of poverty or woe; Of poverty or woe;
533,2
533,That will not murmur or complain
533,Beneath the chastening rod
533,But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain
533,Can lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.
533,3
533,A faith that shines more bright and clear

534,Steadfast and sure while the billows roll

534,It is safely moored, ’twill the storm withstand
534,For ’tis well secured by the Savior’s hand;
534,And the cables passed from His heart to mine
534,Can defy the blast, through strength divine.
534,3
534,It will firmly hold in the straits of fear
534,When the breakers have told the reef is near;
534,Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow
534,Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.
534,4
534,It will surely hold in the floods of death
534,When the waters cold chill our latest breath;
534,On the rising tide it can never fail
534,While our hopes abide within the veil.
534,5
534,When our eyes behold, in the dawning light
534,Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright
534,We shall anchor fast to the heavenly shore
534,With the storms all past forevermore.

536,Yielding unimagined power
536,Facing us with life’s destruction
536,Or our most triumphant hour.

536,Each endeavor well begun;
536,Great Creator, give us guidance

587,His service is the golden cord
587,Close binding all mankind.
587,3

588,1
588,Lord of all nations, grant me grace
588,To love all people, every race
588,And in each person may I see
588,My kindred loved, redeemed by Thee.
588,2
588,Break down the wall that would divide
588,Thy children, Lord, on every side.
588,My neighbor’s good let me pursue;
588,Let Christian love bind warm and true.
588,3
588,Forgive me, Lord, where I have erred
588,By loveless act and thoughtless word.
588,Make me to see the wrong I do
588,Will crucify my Lord anew.
588,4
588,Give me Thy courage, Lord, to speak
588,Whenever strong oppress the weak.
588,Should I myself the victim be
588,Help me forgive, remembering Thee.
588,5
588,With Thine own love may I be filled
588,And by Thy Holy Spirit willed
588,That all I touch, where’er I be
588,May be divinely touched by Thee.
589,589 – Holy Spirit, Gracious Guest
589,1
589,Holy Spirit, gracious guest
589,Hear and grant our heart’s request
589,For that gift supreme and best:
589,Holy heav’nly love.
589,2
589,Faith that mountains could remove
589,Tongues of earth or heaven above
589,Knowledge, all things, empty prove
589,If I have no love.
589,3
589,Though I as a martyr bleed
589,Give my goods the poor to feed
589,All is vain if love I need:
589,Therefore give me love.
589,4
589,Love is kind and suffers long
589,Love is pure and thinks no wrong
589,Love than death it self more strong:
589,Therefore give us love.
589,5
589,Prophecy will fade away
589,Melting in the light of day;
589,Love will ever with us stay:
589,Therefore give us love.
589,6
589,Faith and hope and love we see
589,Joining hand in hand agree-
589,But the greatest of the three
589,And the best is love.
590,590 – Trust and Obey
590,1
590,When we walk with the Lord
590,in the light of his word
590,what a glory he sheds on our way!
590,While we do his good will
590,he abides with us still
590,and with all who will trust and obey.
590,Refrain
590,Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
590,to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
590,2
590,Not a shadow can rise
590,not a cloud in the skies
590,but his smile quickly drives it away;
590,not a doubt nor a fear
590,not a sigh nor a tear
590,can abide while we trust and obey.
590,3
590,Not a burden we bear
590,not a sorrow we share
590,but our toil he doth richly repay;
590,not a grief or a loss
590,not a frown or a cross
590,but is blest if we trust and obey.
590,4
590,But we never can prove
590,the delights of his love
590,until all on the altar we lay;
590,for the favor he shows
590,and the joy he bestows
590,are for them who will trust and obey.
590,5
590,Then in fellowship sweet
590,we will sit at his feet
590,or we’ll walk by his side in the way;
590,what he says we will do
590,where he sends we will go;
590,never fear, only trust and obey.

604,1
604,We know not the hour
604,of the Master’s appearing;
604,Yet signs all foretell
604,that the moment is nearing
604,When He shall return
604,’tis the promise most cheering
604,But we know not the hour.
604,Refrain
604,He will come, let us watch and be ready;
604,He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!
604,He will come in the clouds of His Father’s
604,bright glory but we know not the hour.

605,Renew it boldly every day
605,And help divine implore.

606,606 – Once to Every Man and Nation
606,1
606,Once to every man and nation
606,comes the moment to decide
606,In the strife of truth with falsehood
606,for the good or evil side;
606,Some great cause, some great decision
606,offering each the bloom or blight
606,And the choice goes by forever
606,’twixt that darkness and that light.
606,2
606,Then to side with truth is noble
606,when we share her wretched crust
606,Ere her cause bring fame and profit
606,and ’tis prosperous to be just;
606,Then it is the brave man chooses
606,while the coward stands aside
606,Till the multitude make virtue
606,of the faith they had denied.
606,3
606,By the light of burning martyrs
606,Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track
606,Toiling up new Calv’ries ever
606,with the cross that turns not back;
606,New occasions teach new duties
606,time makes ancient good uncouth
606,They must upward still and onward
606,who would keep abreast of truth.
606,4
606,Though the cause of evil prosper
606,yet the truth alone is strong;
606,Though her portion be the scaffold
606,and upon the throne be wrong;
606,Yet that scaffold sways the future
606,and behind the dim unknown
606,Standeth God within the shadow
606,keeping watch above His own.

607,For the facing of this hour.

607,Free our hearts to faith and praise.
607,Grant us wisdom, grant us courage
607,For the facing of this hour.
607,3

607,Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.

608,That overcomes the world.

608,We tread the road the saints above
608,With shouts of triumph trod.
608,By faith they, like whirlwind’s breath
608,Swept on o’er ev’ry field;
608,The faith by which they conquered death
608,Is still our shining shield.
608,3
608,To him who overcomes the foe
608,White raiment shall be giv’n;
608,Before the angels he shall know
608,His name confessed in heav’n.
608,Then onward from the hills of light
608,Our hearts with love aflame;
608,We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night
608,In Jesus’ conq’ring name.
609,609 – Am I a Soldier of the Cross
609,1
609,Am I a soldier of the cross
609,a follower of the Lamb
609,and shall I fear to own his cause
609,or blush to speak his name?
609,2
609,Must I be carried to the skies
609,on flowery beds of ease
609,while others fought to win the prize
609,and sailed through bloody seas?
609,3
609,Are there no foes for me to face?
609,Must I not stem the flood?
609,Is this vile world a friend to grace
609,to help me on to God?
609,4
609,Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
609,increase my courage, Lord
609,I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain
609,supported by thy word
609,5
609,Thy saints in all this glorious war
609,shall conquer though they die;
609,they see the triumph from afar
609,by faith they bring it nigh
609,6
609,When that illustrious day shall rise
609,and all thy armies shine
609,in robes of victory through the skies
609,the glory shall be thine

611,That calls thee from on high;
611,’Tis He whose hand presents the prize
611,To thine aspiring eye.

611,A cloud of witnesses around
611,Hold thee in full survey;
611,Forget the steps already trod
611,And onward urge thy way.
611,4
611,Blest Savior, introduced by Thee
611,Our race have we begun;
611,And, crowned with victory, at Thy feet
611,We’ll lay our trophies down.

612,We are not divided, all one body we
612,one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.
612,3
612,Crowns and thrones my perish, kingdoms rise and wane
612,but the church of Jesus constant will remain.
612,Gates of hell can never ‘gainst that church prevail;
612,we have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.
612,4
612,Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng
612,blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.

616,Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high
616,Shall take the conquerors home.

617,In a grand and awful time
617,In an age on ages telling
617,To be living is sublime.

617,Take the Spirit’s sword in hand;
617,Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then
617,In Jehovah’s strength to stand.
617,3
617,And the prince of evil spirits
617,Great deceiver of the world!
617,He who at the blessed Jesus
617,Once his deadly weapons hurled
617,Cometh with unwonted power
617,Knowing that his reign will cease
617,When the kingdom shall be given
617,To the mighty Prince of Peace.
617,4
617,Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare
617,Cease not till the victory’s won;
617,Till your Captain loud proclaimeth
617,“Servant of the Lord, well done!”
617,He, alone, who thus is faithful
617,Who abideth to the end
617,Hath the promise, in the kingdom
617,An eternity to spend.

620,1
620,On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand
620,And cast a wishful eye
620,To Canaan’s fair and happy land
620,Where my possessions lie.

620,I am bound for the promised land;
620,O who will come and go with me?
620,I am bound for the promised land.
620,2
620,O’er all those wide extended plain
620,Shines one eternal day;

620,Would here no longer stay;
620,Though Jordan’s waves around me roll
620,Fearless I’d launch away.
620,I am bound for the promised land
620,I am bound for the promised land;
620,O who will come and go with me?
620,I am bound for the promised land.

621,Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
621,In this dark and trying hour.

621,All our graces must be tried;
621,But Thy word illumes our pathway
621,And in God we still confide.
621,2
621,We are in the time of waiting;
621,Soon we shall behold our Lord

623,And I still will follow Thee.

625,1
625,I’m pressing on the upward way
625,New heights I’m gaining every day;
625,Still praying as I’m onward bound
625,“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”
625,Refrain
625,Lord, lift me up and let me stand
625,By faith, on Heaven’s table land

625,And catch a gleam of glory bright;

628,628 – As Jacob With Travel Was Weary
628,1
628,As Jacob with travel was weary one day
628,At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;
628,He saw in a vision a ladder so high
628,That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.
628,Refrain
628,Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree
628,And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me
628,And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.
628,2
628,Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;
628,For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:
628,And remember each step that by faith we passo’er
628,Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.
628,3
628,And when we arrive at the haven of rest
628,We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest
628,Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”
628,O who would not climb such a ladder as this?

629,As Jesus did for men;
629,O happy if ye hunger
629,As Jesus hungered then!
629,3
629,The trials that beset you
629,The sorrows ye endure
629,The manifold temptations
629,That death alone can cure
629,4
629,What are they but His jewels
629,Of right celestial worth?
629,What are they but the ladder
629,Set up to heaven on earth?
629,5
629,O happy band of pilgrims
629,Look upward to the skies
629,Where such a light affliction
629,Shall win you such a prize!

630,1
630,Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings
630,thy better portion trace;
630,Rise from transitory things
630,toward heaven, thy native place;

630,time shall soon this earth remove;
630,Rise, my soul, and haste away
630,to seats prepared above.
630,2
630,Rivers to the ocean run
630,nor stay in all their course;
630,Fire ascending seeks the sun;
630,both speed them to their source;
630,So a soul that’s born of God
630,longs to view His glorious face
630,Forward tends to His abode
630,to rest in His embrace.
630,3
630,Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn;
630,press onward to the prize;
630,Soon our Savior will return
630,triumphant in the skies;
630,Yet a season, and you know
630,happy entrance will be given
630,All our sorrows left below
630,and earth exchanged for heaven.

631,1
631,When on life a darkness falls
631,When the mist flows chilling
631,Paths and sign posts lost in doubt
631,Loveless, unfulfilling
631,Reach us, Jesus, from Your cross
631,Though we feel forsaken;
631,Keep us through the aching night
631,Till new dawns awaken.
631,2
631,When the dreams and vows of youth
631,Painfully accuse us
631,Stab our conscience, steal our worth
631,Christ will not refuse us:
631,Peace the world cannot provide
631,Daily resurrection
631,Strong companion at our side
631,For each new direction.

631,Made His close relation:
631,Christ our pathway, Christ our home
631,Christ our sure foundation.
632,632 – Until Then
632,1
632,My heart can sing when I pause to remember
632,A heartache here is but a stepping stone.
632,Along a trail, thats winding always upward
632,This troubled world, is not my final home.
632,Refrain
632,But until then, my heart will go on singing
632,Until then, with joy I’ll carry on
632,Until the day my eyes behold the city
632,Until the day God calls me home.
632,2
632,The things of earth will dim and lose their value
632,If we recall they’re borrowed for awhile;
632,And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble
632,Remembered there, will only bring a smile.

633,Refrain
633,When we all get to heaven
633,What a day of rejoicing that will be!
633,When we all see Jesus
633,We’ll sing and shout the victory!
633,2
633,While we walk the pilgrim pathway
633,Clouds will overspread the sky;
633,But when traveling days are over
633,Not a shadow, not a sigh.
633,3
633,Let us then be true and faithful
633,Trusting, serving every day;
633,Just one glimpse of him in glory
633,Will the toils of life repay.
633,4
633,Onward to the prize before us!
633,Soon his beauty we’ll behold;
633,Soon the pearly gates will open;
633,We shall tread the streets of gold.
